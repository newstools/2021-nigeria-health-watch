On Saturday, January 30, 2021, at the #PreventEpidemicsNaija Journalism Award ceremony, Nigeria Health Watch honoured and celebrated four journalists for their outstanding reportage on raising awareness on epidemic preparedness and disease outbreaks in Nigeria. From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigerian media proved to be a valuable force in covering issues around the COVID-19 pandemic and in recognition of their exemplary work, in December 2020, the Nigeria Health Watch Prevent Epidemics Project put out a call for nominations of journalists who have produced impactful evidence-based and accurate reports of infectious diseases and epidemic preparedness in Nigeria. The following journalists were celebrated for their exemplary work: Speaking at the award, Dr. Chinwe Ochu, Head of Prevention Programmes and Knowledge Management Department who represented the DG, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control said, “The pandemic has shown the key role the media has to play. A single misinformation from the media that goes viral can cause havoc in the society even more than COVID-19.” She urged the media to always fact check every information before putting it out. Also present at the ceremony were Dr Ngozi Azodoh, Director Health Planning, Research and Statistics, Federal Ministry of Health, Mrs Vivianne Ihekweazu, Managing Director, Nigeria Health Watch, Dr Ifeanyi Nsofor, Director Policy and Advocacy and Project Director, Prevent Epidemics Project, Dr Emmanuel Alhassan, Nigeria Coordinator – Prevent Epidemics, Global Health Advocacy Incubator, representatives from LISDEL and BudgIT and others. Nigeria Health Watch started advocating for more funding for Nigeria’s public health institutes to enable them adequately prepare for epidemics in 2018. The overall goal of this project is to build public awareness and support for epidemic preparedness, and advocate for epidemic preparedness funding increases at Federal and State level.
